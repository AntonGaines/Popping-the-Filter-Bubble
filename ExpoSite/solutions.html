			<h1>What can be done?</h1>

			<h3>The problem is difficult to address, especially without considering the numerous affected groups. There are narrow solutions, we need wide ones which involve these groups.</h3>

			<p class="red"><b>Industry-wide bias recognition and checking:</b></p>
			<p>- This is a wide approach that could easily be pushed under the rug without a technical component like the next one.</p>
			<p>- This, however, would be a great move by the industry leaders to recognize their results can be flawed and to promote individuals do their own research on the topic to become educated.</p>

		<div id="infoDump">
			<p class="red"><b>Search Engine Bias recognition tool:</b></p>
			<p>- This is true technical tool that can be added to search engine results that could promote transparency for the users of the search engine.</p>
			<p>- See the paper for more information on the tool: <a href="https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/search-engine-gender-bias" target="_blank" class="yellow">Search Engine Gender Bias.” Frontiers in big data vol. 4 622106. 26 May. 2021, doi:10.3389/fdata.2021.622106</a></p>

			<p class="red"><b>Push for development changes:</b></p>
			<p>- No political or commercial backing – unlikely in the Attention Economy (see definitions)</p>
			<p>- Not optimized for the user (see definition for Search Engine Optimization) – unlikely because of the way the internet has progressed into individualization</p>

		<div id="infoDump">
			<p class="red"><b>Request results that are not reliant on aspects of one’s Identity:</b></p>
			<p>- Difficult to get right because the journal did not quite hit all of the affected identities.</p>
			<p>- A future solution that can be pursued with a more tangible fix.</p>

			<p class="red"><b>Modifying the algorithm to promote diversity and respect in results </b></p>
