			<h2>This Project</h2>
			<p>Through cookies, computers build an image of you through your actions on the web. Your data becomes you in the eye of your search engine. Your shopping, your searches, your intresets, your social accounts, even your mouse position are all tracked and categorized.</p>
			<p>Search engines, like Google, use this data to optimize their search engine results to best match your data, essentially locking yoiu inside a digital wall, a filter bubble.</p>
			<p>This display seeks to show you examples of a filter bubble and "the algortim" in action; and how they rienforce steryotypes, limit the diversity of your information, and rienforce the world-views of their designers.</p>
			<p>Many groups are affected by filter bubble representation, however this instilation focuses on disabled people, black people, "healthy" people, elderly/ retired people, and people who identify as female.</p>

			<h2>Filter Bubbles</h2>
			<p>Filter Bubbles suggests that our browsing creates a “personal ecosystem of information” that is fed by the attention we give to the content online.</p>
			<p>Mechanisms like cookies and targeted advertising allow for companies to identify users and their interests as they use the internet, and “the algorithm” will feed our results back to us in ways that confirm our beliefs.</p>
			<p>Filter bubbles are sneaky sometimes, and you often won't notice your own until you hit the edge of it. A sign of reaching it is when you just can't find the result you are looking for. Don't feel bad if your searches are biased, being aware of the bubble is often helpful in breaking it.</p>
