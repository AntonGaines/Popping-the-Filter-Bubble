		<p>When looking closely, the difference between these two images is quite dramatic.</p>
		<p>After scrolling to the point where more images needed to be loaded, the filter bubble is seen taking effect very strongly. Joseph's results ciontain many images which appear highly sexualized, while the results from the private tab appear to be more related to people whom have "secretary" in their title.</p>
		<p>It should be noted that the first results for both Joseph and the private tab both had a highly sexual theme to them, although as can be seen above, the private tab moved away from these sooner than Joseph's.</p>
		<p>The harm of results like these are fairly obvious. They subject of the imagry in Joseph's search is inly tangetially related to the search. The results not sexualize continue to predominantly rienforce steryotypes, as well as offer a predominantly male perspect.</p>
