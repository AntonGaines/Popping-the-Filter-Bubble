		<p>Both of the images above were generated by googling "disabled people," clicking on the sub category "disabled," and scrolling to the point where the user was prompted to click "load" more images. This was done to push the results to the edge of the filter bubble.</p>
		<p>As we can see when examaning the images, Joseph's search on the left appears to have far more images of iconography and graphs, while the private tab search maintians the majority of its images as people.<p>
		<p>This is an example of the filter bubble taking effect. Apparently, Joe's cookie data indicated to "the agorith" that he wanted more statistical results. Results like these can be potentially harmful to the communities they represent becuase they shift away from identity-based representation to data-based representation in the images.</p>
